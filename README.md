# Brain-tumor-detection

## Overview
This project classifies brain tumors using MRI images with deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist medical professionals by automatically detecting and categorizing tumor types like glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor.

## Dataset
A public MRI dataset with labeled tumor categories is used. The project utilizes a public brain MRI dataset containing images labeled with corresponding tumor types.

## Features
Preprocessing: Data cleaning and augmentation to enhance image quality and generalize the model.
Model: Various CNN architectures (like VGG16, ResNet50, or custom CNN) are employed to achieve high accuracy.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
